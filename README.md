## Screen Capture

Simple example of screen capture in Golang

- Creates a menu in the system tray labeled `Screen Capture`
- Displays mouse on window in its recorded position
- Clicking `Record` will open a window that displays the continuous screen capture (like a video)
- FIX: `Help` and `Fullscreen` are dummy options for now
- FIX: You must close the capture window to use `Quit`
